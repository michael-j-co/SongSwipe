### 3. Spotify API setup

To connect to the Spotify API, you need to create an `.env` file in the root directory with your Spotify credentials:

Create a file named `.env` and add the following lines:

```bash
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

Make sure to replace the values with your actual **Spotify Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from your Spotify Developer dashboard.

## Running the App üöÄ

Once you've installed the dependencies and set up your `.env` file, run the app locally:

```bash
npm start
```

Or, if using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
